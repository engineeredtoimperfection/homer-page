        <h1>THE TINKERER'S CODE</h1>

        <p>A living manifesto to protect your spark, your curiosity, and your creative autonomy.</p>
        <hr>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve the Spark, Not the System.</strong>
                <p>I create to explore, to learn, to <em>feel alive</em> — not to chase resumes, roles, or checkboxes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>I Choose Play Over Pressure.</strong>
                <p>I’m allowed to experiment, fail, restart, quit, and return. This is <em>my lab</em>, not anyone else’s ladder.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>I Build for Joy First, Usefulness Second.</strong>
                <p>If a silly project makes me smile, I trust that it holds value. That’s where meaning grows.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>I Protect My Energy from External Narratives.</strong>
                <p>Career talk, status games, or judgmental voices — they don’t get to shape my story. Silence is self-defense.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>I Work Small, Often.</strong>
                <p>I don’t need perfect plans or grand visions. A little progress every day is holy.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>I Honor All My Curiosities.</strong>
                <p>Software, music, science, writing — they are not distractions. They are <em>facets</em> of the same creative soul.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>I Will Not Monetize My Passion at the Cost of My Peace.</strong>
                <p>Money will come. But not if it costs the love I’ve found.</p>
            </li>
            
        </ol>
